* Support for realtime conversations in the chat app (websockets maybe?)
* Containerized deployment from the go with Docker
* CI/CD with Github Actions

* Make the frontend SIMPLE and FUNCTIONAL. I am not a frontend developer, so there should be only the essential logic
* Direct communication with the backend via Rest API
* ShadCN Ui components throughout the whole app for consistency
* Color palette: #db4542 #000000 #fcfcfc
* Persistent chat button that opens up a conversation with the AI agent
* Nicely displayed graphs with the relevant data in the dashboard, divided by pages
* Each dashboard page should have a "insights" card that will be sent by the backend
* Containerized deployment from the go with Docker
* CI/CD with Github Actions
